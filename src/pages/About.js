          <h3>Yap Time</h3>
          <p>Hi. Online I go by AwsomChry. Offline, Victor. This website is kind of like a "get to know me" because I have a lot of interests I indulge in, for example:</p>

          <h3>Art</h3>
          <p>So around sophomore of highschool, I was struggling to find anime with good animations or good opening/closing themes and took it upon myself to start creating my own. I tried making my first animation and then realized I couldn't draw. So I tried out pencil and paper, realism, anime, then finally settled with pixel art, but anime. It wasn't until after 3 years that I was finally good at drawing to the point where I would be able to animate. Now, most of my art consists of animations because my brain just wants to let out its creative juices whenever I hear a song.</p>

          <h3>Gaming</h3>
          <p>ARC Raiders is pulling all of my time in the realm of video games. The sound design, visuals, gameplay, mechanics, literally all of it is actually so good. I'm sure there are some other good games out there but ARC Raiders is just more in line with what I'm craving for. I'm so happy it exists. Then there's Minecraft, can't really go wrong with that. Minecraft is kind of my filler arc for video games. I'll get tired of the primary game (previously Fortnite) and the play until I find the next highlight of my life (ARC Raiders).</p>

          <h3>Life</h3>
          <p>I'm pursing a bachelor's computer science with a concentration in artificial intelligence. Since watching Sword Art Online at the ripe old age of 5, all I wanted to do was create using computers and I just happened to get lucky that we're in this era of AI. Since SAO, I've really wanted to create my own robot AI that's basically able to imitate a human. Actually insane that I'll one day be able to create a tiny robot that will be intelligent. Of course, it won't be easy and will be time consuming, but that's part of the fun.</p>
